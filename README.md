A software company is formed to mainly build solutions that a target market has demand for. For a tech company to be generally succesful at what they do, they need to build their software solution in a way that: 

* it continuously delivers value to end users with best UX possible.
* it has high quality and it's well-engineered.
* it's Scalable, maintainable, and future friendly as much as possible.
* it continously minimizes time and financial costs to increase profitability.

High performance software development life cycle checklist

- Structured goal setting that drives what is buitl by developers
- Proceseses are defined in a way that people are not blocked on each other too often
- constantly asking our self this question: Are we automating anything that can be automated?
- Product team always ensures there is high priority work forr engineers to do
- Using version control systems and proper branching and code merging model
- developers have access to logs in all environments
- environments are isolated
- developers can reproduce bugs and test everything in their local environments during development
- there is ownership of the feature all the way to production
- using a issue tracking system
- definition of done for a feature: one word. Impact!
- unit tests(mocking things that need to be mocked), integration tests, end 2 end tests automated
- production bugs triage: low priority bugs vs high priority ones
- Educate engineers to be product-oriented rather than purely thinking technical
- be very attentivete to the word "blocked" and resolve it immediately 
- documentation of the features systematically
- maximize code reusability strategy
- unify design systems, having style guides
- streamline deployments (Continuous software delivery)
- alignment from exec -> product -> development
- Monitoring performance and find what's slowing down on both the front-end and the back-end
- Having a systematic way to monitor security and develop with security in mind
- Load testing in place
- Develop with SEO in mind
- Develop with mobile-first mind set
- Ensure developers are happy and appriciated by having retros

- Design with redundency in mind
- Logging application ouput
- People knowing the big picture
- 6 dysfunctions of a team
- Prioritization model: you know what to work on
- common data exposure protocol
- post mortems when things go wrong
- User activity tracking system
- Have a systematic way to handle escalations and close the loop with support and non-tech stake holders
- Test management in place
- Test plan in place
- Negotiate with the product team constantly
- Get architectral design buy in before implementation
- There is a formalized on boarding process that evolves with the team
- There is onboarding/offboarding strategy and not tying shred documents to people but the org itself
- There is a systematic way of training and onboarding in place for new hires
